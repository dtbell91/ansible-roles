Here is a collection of my Ansible roles.

The roles starting with "ispmail-" were sourced from https://git.workaround.org/chaas/ansible-ispmail-jessie and were released under an MIT license by Christoph Haas (see also https://workaround.org/ispmail/jessie/ansible). There has been some modification to these roles to better suit my needs/a different OS. Unfortunately any commit history that shows this difference was lost by past me's poor choice to work on these Roles in a private repo then throw them over the wall once I knew they didn't contain anything overly personal (passwords, etc).

I'll try my best to keep these up to date with what I'm running. Some of these roles are less complete than others (e.g. `gitlab` isn't at all working, I instead opted to use AWS' CodeCommit to store my private repos).

Feedback/PRs welcome.
